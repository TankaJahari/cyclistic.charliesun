--#nulls

--Identified approximately 550,000 null values for station names/IDs among annual members and around 350,000 for casual users.

--Annual members exhibit slightly more missing data in start_station compared to end_station, approximately 0.4% more.

--Conversely, casual users tend to have fewer null values in start_station data, with a difference of about 14.6%. 

--While the pattern may not directly impact our current analysis, it could be relevant for future considerations.

--#outliers

--Examined ride durations and found that 97.5% of rides last less than an hour (5,577,916 out of 5,718,880). It's not at all unlikely for users to use their bikes for longer than one hour, so I don't want to simply omit all rides past one hour.

--To filter out extreme cases, I implemented an eight-hour (480 minutes) cutoff, affecting only 10,674 rides (0.19%). Some of these extended to *multiple weeks*, potentially skewing our analysis.

--I acknowledge that this is not the ideal or perfect method to determine outliers, and there are scientific ways to more precisely do so, but the sheer volume of observations (almost 6 million) led to my decision to use some more pragmatic decisions for this analysis. .

--I played with methods like z-scores, interquartile range, and using the median absolute deviation, but I need to refresh and supplement my stats skills to effectively use these in future analyses.
