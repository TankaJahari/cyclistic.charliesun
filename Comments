--#nulls

--Roughly ~550,000 null station names/ids for annual members and ~350,000 for casual users. 

--For Annual members, there were more nulls (missing data) in their start_station data than in their end_station data by about 0.4%. 

--For Casual users, the inverse was true: *Less* nulls in start_station data by about 14.6%. So the trips for Casual riders more often had their start_station data while missing a larger proportion of end_station data.

--This pattern may not be relevant to the analysis for our current task, but it could be useful in others so I wanted to include it in some way.


--#outliers


--Examining the data showed that the vast majority of rides (5,577,916 of 5,718,880, 97.5%) being no longer than one hour.

--It is more than possible for users to use their bikes for longer than one hour, so I don't want to simply omit all rides past one hour.

--To be safe, I'll use a cut-off of eight hours, or 480 minutes. Only 10,674 rides out of 5,708,202 rides (0.19%) lasted longer than 480 minutes. There are rides within these 10,674 that lasted multiple WEEKS and would skew our findings 

--*I know this isn't ideal or perfect and there are scientific ways to more precisely determine outliers, but being that I'm working with almost 6 million observations, I'm just moving forward. I played w/ methods like z-scores, interquartile range, and looking at the median absolute deviation (doing some quick research showed that MAD is a robust statistic to measure deviation from the median), but I need to refresh and supplement my stats skills to effectively use these.*
