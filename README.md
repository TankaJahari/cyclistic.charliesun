Case Study Scenario:
Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. As a result, the director of marketing has set a goal to maximize the number of annual members.

Annual members are users that purchase an yearly membership, while casual members are users that purchase either single-ride passes or full-day passes.

In this case study, I am tasked with finding key differences in how annual members and casual members use Cyclistic. These differences will be used to provide insights and recommendations to our stakeholders to help increase the number of annual members. 

Using Cyclistic's data of nearly 6 million rides from 2023, we uncovered several differences in how annual and casual members use the service.

(Ride Duration)
1. Casual members' rides last *much* longer on average than those of annual members. On average, casual users' rides last over 28 minutes while annual users' rides last 12 and a half minutes.

(Bike Type)
2. Casual members show a preference for electric bikes over classic bikes, whereas annual members seemed to show no particular preference towards either. Out of ~3.7 million annual member rides, the two bike types have a nearly perfect 50/50 split. Casual members 

(Day of Week)
3. Casual members had most rides on the weekends, while the inverse was true for annual members.

(Monthly)
4. Comparing the rides per month for usertypes showed no difference. Chicago is a very season-dependent city, and there is no surprise that both user types rode more during the spring/summer months.

(Start Location Map)
5. Using start location long/lat coordinate as datapoints, we can see on our map that casual member rides are much more spread out throughout Chicago. 

There is additionally a high conecntration of rides seen along the lake shore. Multiple "hotspots" along the shore create a sort of line.

While the density map did show a visible concentration of rides near the lake shore for annual members, it is much smaller (less hotspots) and less dense/intense/dark.

Out of 2,058,763 casual rides, there were 766,673 unique start locations.
Out of 3,660,117 annual rides, there were 1,274,413 unique start locations.
